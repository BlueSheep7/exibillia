friend: Yeah, what's up?

me: Did you get my message last night?

friend: No, what message?

me: I sent you a pic. Something weird in it.

me: Hold on, I'll resend it.
me: |window.png

friend: What am I looking at?

me: Look in the background, near the window.

friend: Is that... a face?

me: Yeah! I didn't see anyone when I took it.

friend: Creepy. Could be a reflection?

me: I checked. No one else was there. And look at this.

friend: What is it?

me: |window_zoomed.png
me: Zoomed in on the face.

friend: It looks like it's... smiling?

me: Exactly. And I swear it wasn't there when I took the pic.

friend: Maybe a trick of the light?

me: I thought so too, but...

friend: But?

me: I saw it again. Outside my window.

friend: When?

me: Just now. It was smiling at me.

friend: You're joking, right?

me: I wish. It's gone now, but it was there.

friend: Are you sure you're not just tired or something?

me: I know what I saw.

friend: Okay, okay. Just take it easy. Maybe you should get some rest.

me: Maybe. But if I see it again...

friend: Let me know. Seriously.

me: Will do. Thanks.

me: Are you awake?

friend: Yeah, why?

me: It's back. Outside my window again.

friend: Are you sure?

me: Yes. It's staring right at me.

friend: Do you want me to come over?

me: Please. I don't feel safe.

friend: On my way. Hang tight.

friend: I'm outside. Where are you?

me: In my room. It's still there.

friend: I don't see anything.

me: It's right there! Near the tree.

friend: There's nothing here. Are you okay?

me: I'm telling you, it's there!

friend: Come outside. I'll check inside with you.

me: Fine. I'm coming.

friend: Where are you?

me: Coming down the stairs.

friend: Hurry. I don't like this.

me: I see you. Open the door.

friend: The door is open. Where are you?

me: I'm right here! In front of you.

friend: No, you're not. I'm in your living room.

me: Stop joking. I'm standing right in front of you!

friend: Turn around.

me: What? There's nothing...

me: It's behind me.

friend: What do you see?

me: A face. Smiling.

friend: Run!

me: I can't move.

friend: What do you mean?

me: It's got me.

friend: I'm coming inside.

me: Too late.

friend: What do you mean?

me: It's over.

friend: What's over?

me: I'm not me anymore.

friend: Who is this?

me: It's smiling.
